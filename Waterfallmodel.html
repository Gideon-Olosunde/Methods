<div class="border">
<p>The Waterfall cycle is a development method which consists of 6 stages.</p>


<p> The first stage of the model is determining requirements for the product you are producing. This is usually done by gathering data from the consumers using surveys, questionnaires etc..</p>



<p> The second stage of the model is analysis of the product you want to produce. This stage requires you to consider the legal, economical and feasibility of you product. e.g. Is the technology available to create you product in the first place, will you have sufficient funding for the full development of the product etc..</p>

<p> The third stage of the model is the design phase. This stage is where you consider the hardware and systems you will use in the development of your product.</p>



<p>The fourth section is the coding . This is the actually coding required in the development of the product.</p>



<p>The fifth stage is the testing section. This is the section where you diagnose you code and identify any problems which need fixing you can then track back and through the other stages to see if there are any problems in the previous stages.
m
</p>
<p> the last section of the model is the maintenance stage. In this section you provide updates for the software you have created to keep it working the way it should and you add improvements to the code.</p>

<ol> Pros of the waterfall model
<li>The waterfall model is very rigid and has set stages for developers to follow when creating software, this makes it very easy to plan and create the software. </li>


<li>This method of development is very good for small projects where the requirements are very little because this reduces the time it takes to develop the software while also allowing for the best product possible to be produced.</li>
<li>The development process is very well documented so  allowing the developers to see the stages leading to the current position allowing mistakes to be easily highlighted and diagnosed, and for future members of the development team to quickly gain knowledge of the process so far.</li>
<li>This method helps reduce the cost of development in later stages as a lot of the later stages will already have been planned out and ideas would have been collected on how to minimise the costs of development. </li>
</ol>
<br>

<ol> Cons of the waterfall model
<li> The waterfall model isn't very adaptive to changes in the requirement, which means that if you were at the latter stages of the development you would have to start at the beginning of the model to reconsider the new requirements, which wastes time and money.</li> 
<li> No working software is produced till the end stages of the model which mean that the client isn't going to have any type of physical product for a long time </li>
<li>The efficiency of code isn't prioritised which means that the code isn't very well refactored to simplify the coding stages resulting in long inefficient code which may be hard to understand later on when the code needs updating.</li>
