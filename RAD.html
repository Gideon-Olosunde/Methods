 <p> The RAD model puts emphasis on prototyping and iterative development, with no specific plan for the development of the software.Unlike the waterfall model the client is heavily involved in the development of the product and the prototypes are constantly being reviewed by the client until the prototype fits the clients needs.
<p> The steps for this model are fairly simple, you determine the requirements by gaining as much information about the end product the client wishes to have, then you build a prototype of the product based of the information you have, you then evaluate the prototype with the client to see if the prototype is close to the product they wanted, if not you review the the client's comments on the prototype and make the changes needed.</p>
<ol> Pros of RAD model
<li> This model is very effective when it comes to designing a product where the requirements aren't fully known as prototypes are constantly being created until the client feels that that is the product the wish to acquire.</li>
<li> Due to the fact that this model has no planning stage it makes it very easy to implement changes to the current design of the product.</li>
<li> The model is very easy to follow, as it is the constant creation of prototypes.
</ol>


<ol> Cons of the RAD model
<li>The model has a high dependency on the good skilled team members, who are able to work fast to create each of the prototypes for reviewing, if they fail to do there jobs the model my fail leading to the development failing and being stopped resulting in a large loss of money if this were to occur in later stages.</li>
<li>The model also depends highly on the client involvement if the client fails to communicate with the development team properly this could also lead to the project failing. </li>
<li>This method isn't very good for large projects as the process will be very time consuming and the constant creation of prototypes can be very expensive.</li>
</ol>

<p><b> The spiral model implements both the RAD and waterfall model. The model add the RAD prototyping and adds risk analysis to the waterfall model. The model is split into 4 quadrants.</b>
<ol> 
<li>Determine objectives, alternatives and constraints.This stage also includes getting information about the system requirements from the client.There is continuous communication between the user and the developers.</li>
<li>Evaluate alternatives, risks are identified and resolved. if risks are too high, the project may be halted. </li>
<li>The prototype is developed. </li>
<li>Planning takes place for the next phase </li>
</ol>

<ul>Pros of the Spiral model
<li> The spiral model is ideal for risky and complex projects.</li>
<li> The model is flexible so it can be easily adapted to fit a change in requirements.</li>
<li> The implementation of the Rad model has more user involvement allowing, allowing for better communication between the developer and the client.</li>
<li> development of software is faster.</li>
<li> This model has risk analysis which is very important when evaluating how feasible the development will be.
</ul>

<ul>Cons of the Spiral model
<li>Risk analysis is and important step so this requires an expert risk analyst, who are very expensive.</li>
<li>This development model is not ideal for smaller projects as it requires a lot of resources to be used with little of the money used made back.</li>
</ul>
