<h2 class="title">Agile</h2>

<div class="border">
<p>Agile isn’t necessarily a Methodology but a set of principles which developers may wish to follow, to develop a successful software for their clients.the agile manifesto is like a guideline to what contributes to a successful software development.The manifesto say that when developing software we should prioritise individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation ,which means that you should have more frequent working software to show the client the progress you have made rather than having documented it all d own as it is a better representation of progress. You should also prioritise adapting to change rather than following a plan.</p>
<br>
<p>The manifesto is based on 12 principles</p>
<ol>
<li>early and continuous delivery of software</li>
<li>welcome changing requirements even in late development</li>
<li>working software is delivered frequently</li>
<li>Face to Face communication (co-location) is the best way to convey informationbetween client and developers.</li>
<li>code efficiency is prioritised</li>
</ol>

<p>However while the manifesto is an improvement to the Waterfall model it has it problems.
The Agile manifesto is not very good in large companies as it makes communication aspect of the manifesto.The Developers need to be in the same geographical area to be able to assist in the development as there programming is in pairs.The team of developers need to be very specialised as they need to be able to put up the work done by others and carry on with out too much trouble as it slows down development. </p>

<p>Scrum is a methodology based of the agile manifesto.Scrum has three main groups of people, the product owner(client), the scrum master, the team.the product owner is the person with the ideas for the product, he/she makes a backlog of features they want the product to have and they communicate with the scrum master about the feature in the backlog. The scrum master is the person who manages the team of developers and makes sure that the team is following the plans laid out.The team consists of all the people woking on development not just the programmers, the teams job is to make sure that they get the work done as planned and make sure that a product is available to show the client that progress is being made.At the start of Scrum the client proposes there product backlog.The client also prioritises which features they wish to see first .The Scrum master then conveys the information to the team.The project is then broken-down into different stages.These stages are called sprints. over a specific amount of time each set to be done . e.g the developers may have 1 month to complete the tasks in the first sprint.At the end of each sprint the client may be consulted to review the process. then the process starts again the Scrum master gets feedback from the client, then conveys it to the team and plans are made to a certain time period. Each time a sprint is done an item for the clients product backlog is usually completed.the Scrum model has the same limitation as the agile manifesto doese.g.teams whose members have very specialised skills. In Scrum, developers should be able to work on any task or pick up work that another developer has started.</p>

<p>The XP programming model has four main processes; coding testing, listening, design.The coding stage is said to be one of the more important stages as without the coding there is no working product, so the efficiency of the code is taken as a priority.In the testing stage different tests are done. The units test this test if the coded features work as intended.the programmers write as many of the tests that they can think of that will crash/break the code the goal of this is to test the boundaries of the code and to see what it can and can’t handle.The next test is the acceptance test. this test is to see that the coded feature is as the client intended and that the programmers have understood the clients request.the listening stage is where the developers listen to the clients requests face to face and pose some technical issues that they may face and offer some alternative or solution to the problem to see how the client feels about the ideas.The design stage is where the system is designed. the system is refactored in this stage and made simpler. it is also made sure that the system is easily adaptable by making sure that when parts of the system are removed or changed that it doesn’t affect the whole system. i.e the system isn’t dependant on part to make it work.</p>
